"Hey, [mirror]Shard[/color]!" 

Yun's voice rings through the phone. Confusion rises as you're unsure of why he'd ever call you, considering how the last exchange went.

"I got a new lead on something big... Though I'm a bit short on cash. Can you lend me some?" His monotone speech fills you with anemoia.

There is a growing uncomfortable silence between the two of you, eventually broken by Yun.

"No, seriously, I have a good feeling about this. Might be the last contract I have to do for a while..."

There is a hint of desperation in his voice that breaks the cold and serious persona for a moment.&lt;/i&gt;
