             <text id="MysteryCh5_1Frame0Dia0">Circus performances are in full swing here.
A bizarre-looking clown, a crooked lion, an elephant with a human's hand... is this the taste of City dwellers?
It's okay to visit for a while if you want.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_1Frame0Choice0Desc">Watch a performance(All Librarians current HP - 20%. Get 'inspiration')</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_1Frame0Choice1Desc">Pass over</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_1Frame1Dia0">All the Librarians who watched the ghastly, glamorous, and grotesque performance were exhausted, but on the other hand, they seem to have realized something in the content of the performance.
But they may not be able to explain themselves what it is.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_1Frame1Choice0Desc">End</text>

             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Title">Prescript</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame0Dia0">A citizen comes to us with a box.
"The Prescript telling me to hand this to you."
There are quite a few bills in the box.

It is said that Prescripts are always made to the advantage of the Index.
...Let's think for a moment about what it means to receive this.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame0Choice0Desc">Receive(Get 40 Ahn)</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame0Choice1Desc">Ignore</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame1Dia0">You have received a box.
What's good for the Index isn't necessarily bad for us.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame1Choice0Desc">End</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame2Dia0">You did not receive the box.
The citizen who failed to undertake the Prescript's countenance darkened, but we don't care about it.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2Frame2Choice0Desc">End</text>

 <text id="MysteryCh5_2_1Title">Result of the Prescript</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2_1Frame0Dia0">"It's you guys. Messing with Thumb's stuff."
Thumb's Capo and Soldato appeared and aimed their guns at us.
...the result of the Prescript came like this.</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2_1Frame0Choice0Desc">Begin Battle!</text>
             <text id="MysteryCh5_2_1Frame0Choice1Desc">Beg for life (Use 60 Ahn)</text>
