Precious things are already gone, but when I look around, there are still useful items.
Even if it's old, you can use it yourself, as it is a Workshop-made item, or maybe you can find good buyers.</text>

             <text id="MysteryCh4_3Frame0Dia0">Gunshots ring out! You quickly hid behind cover.
You can see mysterious attackers shooting from above the building. It's too far away, so it's hard to counterattack.
Don't know if anyone ordered it or if they were just robbers, but they won't be able to fire expensive bullets forever.</text>

But not everyone works that way. Spying, trespassing, stealing... There are plenty of things to do in secret.
Such a quest came to you, who only fought recklessly. Can you really do it?
